Vector Search Engine
======

Introduction
------
  This project is a vector search engine based on inverted files , by which you can find relevant files by using the the method of td-idf.

Environment
------
* Language: Python3
* Network Framework: Flask 0.12.2

Principle
------
In the Vector Space Model, we need to
* Represent every document as a vector
* Represent a query as a vector
* A method for measuring similarity between any two vectors

Tf-Idf:
* tf.idf(t,d) = tf(t,d)*idf(t)
* idf(t) = log(N/df(t))

Run
------
* 1st: put your example files into the "files" directory
* 2nd: run the inverted_file.py
* 3rd: run the app.py 
* 4th: open the url in your browser and then use it
